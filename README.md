# musician-finder

## Description
Musician Finder is a web application designed to serve as a central hub for music fans to look up their favorite artists and access information about them. Our current feature set includes displaying an artist's picture, top songs, top albums, and any upcoming tour dates. We are also working on adding lyrics and guitar tabs for the top songs in the near future.

In the process of building this application, our team gained valuable experience working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to interact with third-party APIs. We also honed our collaboration skills as a small group, learning how to divide the work effectively and manage a GitHub repository.

Try out Musician Finder by visiting our deployed application at: https://reginaldcapanzana.github.io/musician-finder/
Please note that the site may be temporarily unavailable due to an expired API. We are working to resolve this issue as soon as possible.

Thank you for choosing Musician Finder to explore your favorite artists!

## Usage

The user can enter the name of a band or artist in the search bar and click the search button. This will populate the page with information about the artist and create a new button so they can easily search that artist again. There is also a clear button which removes all the information from the page.
