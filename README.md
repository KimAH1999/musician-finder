## Description

We built this application to act as a hub where music fans can look up their favorite artists and find information about them. Currently, the application will display a picture of the artist, along with their top songs, top albums, and any upcoming tour dates. In the future we plan to add lyrics and guitar tabs for the top songs. This is a useful tool for anyone who wants to learn about any band or artist they like.

In the process of building this application, we learned a lot about how HTML, CSS, and Javascript can interact with each other and with third parties. We also learned how to a small group can best divide the work and share a github repository.

## Usage

The user can enter the name of a band or artist in the search bar and click the search button. This will populate the page with information about the artist and create a new button so they can easily search that artist again. There is also a clear button which removes all the information from the page.
